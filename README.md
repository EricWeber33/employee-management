# Take-home Assignment (Full Stack) #

### Goal: ###
* Create an Employee Table like the one in the image below.
* Use any front-end framework (Angular, React, Vue, ect...) or CSS library to accomplish this.
* Implement the back-end API with a Node.js framework, and a SQL database

### Functional Requirements: ###
* Initially, list all employees that are in data.json
  * First name, last name, and salary in currency format (ie. $42,000)
* The ability to edit an employee
* The ability to delete an employee
* The ability to create a new employee

### Technical Guidelines: ###
* Structure your application and components in a modular/reusable way
* Commit code with useful and informative comments
* Your application doesn't have to use the data.json file directly, but have a SQL script to initialize your database with data found in that file
* Implement API code to read and write to a SQL database
* Styling: CSS or SCSS or SASS can be used, whichever you prefer (can use popular UI frameworks like Bootstrap as well)
